![APP Screenshot](images/project-screenshot.png)

A simple yet powerful URL shortening API built with Laravel 11. This API allows users to shorten URLs, retrieve shortened URLs, perform redirections, and track visit statistics (V2). It also includes authentication using **Sanctum** for secure user access.

## ✨ Features

- **User Authentication** (via Laravel Sanctum)
	+ User registration, login, and logout
- **URL Shortening**
	+ Shorten long URLs
	+ Retrieve the URLs shortened by a user
- **URL Redirection**
	+ Redirect users to the original URL using a short link
- **URL Visit Counting** (available in v2 of the API)
- **API Versioning** (v1 and v2)
- Secure, clean, and well-structured API with response messages

## 🚀 Usage 

### 🔒 Authentication

To access most endpoints, users must authenticate via Personal Access Tokens using [Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/sanctum).

1. **Register a User**: Send a POST request to `/api/v1/register` to create a new user.
2. **Log In**: Send a POST request to `/api/v1/login` to receive a token.
3. **Use the Token**: Include the token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer {token}` for subsequent requests like shortening URLs, retrieving shortened URLs, logging out, etc.


### 🔗 Shorten URL

To shorten a URL, send a POST request to `/api/v1/shorten` with the following payload:

```json
{
    "original_url": "https://example.com"
}
```

This will return the shortened URL along with the original URL & the visit count.

### 🔄 Redirect to Original URL

To redirect to the original URL, simply send a GET request to the shortened URL (authentication not required) like so: `GET /v1/{short_url}`.

Then you will be redirected to the original URL.
